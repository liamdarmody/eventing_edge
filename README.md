# Eventing Edge Website

Created for Eddie Yacoubian at Eventing Edge.

## Tools
- Github
- Sublime Text
- iTerm
- Jekyll
- BitBalloon

## Maintenance
Once the tools have been setup, you can use the following instructions to make changes to the website:
1. Clone the repo from Github
2. Navigate to the team page and update code accordingly (in Sublime Text)
3. Copy an event page to maintain the correct structure, then update the name and content accordingly (in Sublime Text)
4. In iTerm, type the following command 'jekyll serve'. This command should auto-generate your static website in the '_site' folder and serve it up on the local server (http://127.0.0.1:4000/)
5. Add, commit and push your code to git for safe keeping
6. When you have made the updates locally and are happy with the changes, deployment is easy. Go to the '_site' folder, then drag and drop the entire thing into BitBalloon. BitBalloon will update the website and the changes should go live immediately.

This list is assuming some basic knowledge about git and how to navigate to a folder in the terminal.
